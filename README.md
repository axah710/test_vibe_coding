## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites:
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed.
- An IDE (e.g., Android Studio, VSCode) configured for Flutter development.
- (Optional) Firebase account if you’re using Firebase as your backend.

### Steps:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-finance-app.git
   cd personal-finance-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Backend Services:**
   - For Firebase: Follow the Firebase integration guide to add your `google-services.json` (Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS).
   - For custom backends: Update the API endpoints and credentials in the configuration files.

4. **Run the App:**

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Evaluation Criteria & Potential Issues

The project is subject to a systematic review across multiple dimensions. Each category below is evaluated, with “No issues found” explicitly noted where applicable:

- **Performance Bottlenecks:**  
  - *Issue*: Slow data loading or widget rebuilds.  
  - *Mitigation*: Optimize asynchronous calls and widget recycling.
  
- **Maintainability & Readability:**  
  - *Issue*: Complex codebases and poor documentation.  
  - *Mitigation*: Adhere to coding standards, provide inline comments, and use automated static analysis.
  
- **Scalability:**  
  - *Issue*: System failures under high loads.  
  - *Mitigation*: Use scalable backend services and caching strategies.
  
- **OOP & Functional Programming:**  
  - *Issue*: Inappropriate design patterns or tight coupling.  
  - *Mitigation*: Follow SOLID principles and leverage dependency injection.
  
- **Data Structures & Algorithms:**  
  - *Issue*: Poor algorithmic complexity impacting performance.  
  - *Mitigation*: Optimize data structures and algorithms based on Big O notation.
  
- **Design Patterns & Clean Code:**  
  - *Issue*: Code smells or misapplied design patterns.  
  - *Mitigation*: Regular code reviews and refactoring sessions.
  
- **Security & OWASP Compliance:**  
  - *Issue*: Vulnerabilities in authentication or data storage.  
  - *Mitigation*: Implement encryption, regular security audits, and adhere to OWASP guidelines.
